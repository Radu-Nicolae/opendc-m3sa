# Integration Steps

We build our tool towards performance, scalability, and **universality**. In this document, we present the steps to
integrate our tool into your simulation infrastructure.

## Step 1: Adapt the simulator output folder structure

The first step is to adapt the I/O of your simulation to the format of our tool. The output folder structure should have
the
following format:

```
🔧  [1] - simulation-folder-name
🔒  [2] | - inputs
🔧  [3] | | - {m3sa-config-file}.json
🔧  [4] | | - {other input files / folders}
🔒  [5] | - outputs
🔒  [6] | | - raw-output
🔒  [7] | | | - 0
🔒  [8] | | | | - seed={your_seed}
🔧  [9] | | | | | - {simulation_data_file}.parquet
⚪  [10]| | | | | - {any other files}
⚪🔒[11]| | | - 1
⚪🔒[12]| | | | - seed={your_seed}
⚪🔧[13]| | | | | - {simulation-results-file-name}.parquet
⚪󠁪  [14]| | | | | - {any other files}
⚪  [15]| | | - metamodel
⚪  [16]| | | | | - {your_metric_name}.parquet
⚪  [17]| | | | | - {any other files}
⚪  [18]| | - {any other files / folders}
⚪  [19]| - {any other files / folders}
```

🔒 = fixed, the name of the folder/file must be the same.<br>
🔧 = flexible, the name of the folder/file can differ. However, the item must be present.<br>
⚪ = optional and flexible. The item can be absent. <br>

- [1] = the name of the analyzed folder
- [2] = the inputs folder, containing various inputs / configuration files
- [3] = the name of the configuration file for M3SA, can be (almost) any name, but needs to be a JSON
  file
- [4] = any other input files or folders
- [5] = output folder, containing the raw-output. can contain any other files or folders, besides the raw-output folder.
  After running a simulation, also a "simulation-analysis" folder will be generated
- [6] = raw-output folder, containing the raw output of the simulation
- [7],[11] = the IDs of the models. Must always start from zero. Possible values are 0, 1, 2 ... n, metamodel. The id
  of "metamodel" is reserved for the Meta-Model. Any simulation data in the respective folder will be treated as
  Meta-Model data.
- [8],[12] = the seed of the simulation. the seed must be the same for both [8], [12], and other equivalent, further
  files.
- [9],[13] = the file in which the simulation data is stored. The name of the file can differ, but it must be a parquet
  file.
- [10],[14] = any other files or folders
- [15] = the Meta-Model folder, optional. If the folder is present, the data in the folder will be treated as Meta-Model
  data.
- [16] = the Meta-Model output. The name of the file is of the type ```{your_metric_name}.parquet```. For example, if
  you analyze CO2 emissions, the file will be named ```co2_emissions.parquet```.
- [17],[18],[19] = any other files or folders

## Step 2: Adapt the simulation file format

The simulator data file must be a **parquet** file.

The file must contain (at least) the following columns: "timestamp", "your_metric_name". Other columns do not harm.

- timestamp: the timestamp, in miliseconds, of the data point
- your_metric_name: the value of the metric at the given timestamp

e.g., if you are analyzing the CO2 emissions of a datacenter, for a timeperiod of 5 minutes, and the data is samples
every
30 seconds, the file will look like this:

| timestamp | co2_emissions |
|-----------|---------------|
| 30000     | 31.2          |
| 60000     | 31.4          |
| 90000     | 28.5          |
| 120000    | 31.8          |
| 150000    | 51.5          |
| 180000    | 51.2          |
| 210000    | 51.4          |
| 240000    | 21.5          |
| 270000    | 21.8          |
| 300000    | 21.2          |

## Step 3: Running M3SA

#### Arguments for Main.py Setup

"experiments/experiment-2-window-performance-analysis/outputs/" "
experiments/experiment-2-window-performance-analysis/inputs/m3saSetup.json"
Main.py takes two arguments:

1. Argument 1 is the path to the output directory where M3SA output files will be stored.
2. Argument 2 is the path to the input file that contains the configuration of M3SA.

e.g.,

```json
"simulation-123/outputs/" "simulation-123/inputs/multi-meta-configurator.json"
```

#### Working directory Main.py Setup

Make sure to set the working directory to the directory where the main.py file is located.

e.g.,

```
/your/path/to-analyzer/src/main/python
```

If you are using OpenDC, you can set the working directory to the following path:

```
/your/path/opendc/opendc-analyze/src/main/python
```
